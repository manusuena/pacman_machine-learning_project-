# pacman_machine-learning_project-
Machine-learning techniques were used to train Pacman into playing autonomously     
The file mlLearningAgents.py is the file that uses my Q-learning code to train pacman.
The other files are needed to run the pacman simulation and are provided by http://ai.berkeley.edu/reinforcement.html. 
To test the code pacman.py -p QLearnAgent -x 2000 -n 2010 -l smallGrid were -x 
is the number of training scenarios, -n is the number of testing scenarios and -l determines the size of the grid.
